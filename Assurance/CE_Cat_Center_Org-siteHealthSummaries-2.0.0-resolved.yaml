  description: "### OpenAPI specification defined for the purpose of providing visibility into the overall health data of specific sites or groupings of sites present in Catalyst Center\n\n**Relevant Concepts**\n\n| Term | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Good` | Health scores which fall within the [inclusive] range of 8 - 10 |\n| `Access` | Network devices that belong to the access layer [1st of 3 layers in Network Hierarchy]. These generally include: Wireless Controllers, APs, and Switches |\n| `Distribution` | Network devices that belong to the distribution layer [2nd of 3 layers in Network Hierarchy]. These generally include: Routers and Switches layer [2nd of 3 layers in Network Hierarchy]. These generally include: Routers and Switches |\n|`Core` | Network devices that belong to the core layer [3rd of 3 layers in Network Hierarchy]. These generally include: Switches |\n|`Wireless` | Network devices that make up the wireless network. These generally include: Wireless Controllers and APs. |\n| `Wired` | Network devices that make up the wired network. These generally include: Switches and Routers. |\n| `Clients` | Devices which are connected to the network. These can be either wired or wireless. |\n| `Site` | A geographical location where devices are added |\n\n**API Support Documentation**\n\n**Views**\n\nSpecified 'views' can be requested for non-count APIs.

      description: |
        Get a paginated list of site health summaries. Use the available query parameters to identify a subset of sites you want health summaries for.
        This API provides the latest health data from a given `endTime`
        If data is not ready for the provided endTime, the request will fail, and the error message will indicate the recommended endTime to use to retrieve a complete data set.
        This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we are not a real time system.
        When `endTime` is not provided, the API returns the latest data.
        This API also provides issue data. The `startTime` query param can be used to specify the beginning point of time range to retrieve the active issue counts in. When this param is not provided, the default `startTime` will be 24 hours before endTime.
        Valid values for `sortBy` param in this API are limited to the attributes provided in the `site` view.
        Default sortBy is 'siteHierarchy' in order 'asc' (ascending)

    get:
      tags:
      - siteHealthSummaries
      summary: Read a trend of site health summary data by site id
      description: |
        Retrieves the time series information of health and issue data for a site specified by the path parameter. The data will be grouped based on the specified trend time interval. If startTime and endTime are not provided, the API defaults to the last 24 hour period where a complete data set exists, and a trendInterval of 1 hour.

        If a startTime or endTime is provided, both must be provided.

        A request with a startTime and endTime provided, must also include a specified trendInterval.

        If data is not ready for the provided endTime, the request will fail,
        and the error message will indicate the recommended endTime to use to retrieve
        a complete data set.

        This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we
        are not a real time system.

        If the time range requested is >= 24 hours, valid trend intervals are:
        [1HR, 1DAY, 7DAY]

        By default:
        - the applied limit of records returned will be 500, and applied offset will be 1.
        - the records will be sorted in time ascending (`asc`) order

        This API is asynchronous due to the large amounts of data being processed and inherent latency associated with that.

        **The process for using this API is as follows**:

        1). Make request to API to generate intended trend data. This request can include any of the following query parameters:

        [startTime, endTime, trendInterval, limit, offset, and order]

        The request MUST include the following query parameters:

        [attribute]

        For a list of supported trend analytics attributes, see main description.

        2). The response will be a 202 HTTP code, with information regarding the generated taskId for this submitted request and the URL to poll the status of this task.

        ex. "/dna/data/api/v1/assuranceTasks/bcbb2a8c-deae-4a3e-9459-0eb1dc12c191"


        3). Once the status is completed, the response data will be retrievable using this API with a taskId query param.

        ex. /dna/data/api/v1/siteHealthSummaries/{id}/trendAnalytics?taskId=bcbb2a8c-deae-4a3e-9459-0eb1dc12c191.

        When a taskId is provided, it is the ONLY query parameter that should be provided to this API.

      summary: Read a trend of site health summary data
      description: |
        Retrieves the time series information of health and issue data for sites specified by query parameters, or all sites. The data will be grouped based on the specified trend time interval. If startTime and endTime are not provided, the API defaults to the last 24 hour period where a complete data set exists, and a trendInterval of 1 hour.

        If a startTime or endTime is provided, both must be provided.

        A request with a startTime and endTime provided, must also include a specified trendInterval.

        If data is not ready for the provided endTime, the request will fail,
        and the error message will indicate the recommended endTime to use to retrieve
        a complete data set.

        This behavior may occur if the provided endTime=currentTime, since we
        are not a real time system.

        If the time range requested is >= 24 hours, valid trend intervals are:
        [1HR, 1DAY, 7DAY]

        By default:
        - the applied limit of records returned will be 500, and applied offset will be 1.
        - the records will be sorted in time ascending (`asc`) order

        This API is asynchronous due to the large amounts of data being processed and inherent latency associated with that.

        **The process for using this API is as follows**:

        1). Make request to API to generate intended trend data. This request can include any of the following query parameters:

        [startTime, endTime, siteHierarchy, siteHierarchyId, siteType, id, trendInterval, limit, offset, and order]

        The request MUST include the following query parameters:

        [attribute]

        For a list of supported trend analytics attributes, see main description.

        2). The response will be a 202 HTTP code, with information regarding the generated taskId for this submitted request and the URL to poll the status of this task.

        ex. "/dna/data/api/v1/assuranceTasks/bcbb2a8c-deae-4a3e-9459-0eb1dc12c191"


        3). Once the status is completed, the response data will be retrievable using this same API, by providing the query parameter:

        [taskId].

        ex. /dna/data/api/v1/siteHealthSummaries/trendAnalytics?taskId=bcbb2a8c-deae-4a3e-9459-0eb1dc12c191.

        When a taskId is provided, it is the ONLY query parameter that should be provided.

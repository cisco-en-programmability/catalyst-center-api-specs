      summary: Get all application health score definitions.
      description: |
        Get all application health score definitions for given filter.

        By default all supported attributes are listed in the response.

        Following diagram explains the various thresholds, and corresponding health score range:

        ```
        badThreshold            poorThreshold             goodThreshold            greatThreshold
             |-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
                    Poor (1-3)                 Fair (4-7)                Good (8-10)
        ```

        Final health score is calcuated as follows:
        * For each KPI (e.g. jitter), KPI-specific health score is calculated using thresholds explained above.
        * Overall health score is derived by performing weighted average of all KPIs.

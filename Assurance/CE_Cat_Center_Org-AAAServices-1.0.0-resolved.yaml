    This collection of APIs provides data related to AAA Services
    offered in Catalyst Center. The data is calculated for the given time range. Transaction fields are summed up and latncy fields are averaged. Transaction and latency data is returned for the two phases of the authentication process -
          1) EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol
          2) MAB - MAC Authentication Bypass

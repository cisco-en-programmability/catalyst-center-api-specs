      summary: Retrieves the Trend analytics data related to network applications.
      description: |-
        Retrieves the trend analytics of applications experience data for the specified time range. The data will be grouped based on the given trend time interval. This API facilitates obtaining consolidated insights into the performance and status of the network applications over the specified start and end time. If startTime and endTime are not provided, the API defaults to the last 24 hours. `siteId` and `trendInterval` are mandatory. `siteId` must be a site UUID of a building.

        **The input payload contains the following fields,**
        |Field Name | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `startTime` | The start time indicates when the API begins retrieving data related to the resource. It must be specified in the UNIX epoch time format, measured in milliseconds. This value is inclusive, and if left unspecified, the default is 1 day before the  endTime.|
        | `endTime` | The end time indicates the upper limit until which the API retrieves data related to the resource. It must be defined in the UNIX epoch time format, measured in milliseconds. This value is inclusive, and if left unspecified, the default is the latest available data. |
        | `siteIds` |  The list of site UUIDs. This is a mandatory field. Please note that only Building UUIDs are allowed for this field.|
        | `trendInterval` |  The time window for aggregating metrics. This is a mandatory request field. Possible values include *5 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour or 3 hour. Upto 3 hours time window allowed intervals 5MIN and 10MIN and more than 3 hours time window allowed intervals 1HR and 3HR. |
        | `groupBy` | Specifies the attributes for grouping the data. Refer to `NetworkApplicationGroupByField` model for the supported grouping attributes|
        | `attributes` | A list of attributes associated with the resource, which can be requested to be included in the response alongside the required attributes. Refer to `NetworkApplicationTrendAttribute` model for the supported attributes |
        | `aggregateAttributes` | This specifies the attribute name and the function to be applied during data querying. The aggregate function is then applied to data within the specified start and end times. Refer to `NetworkApplicationAggregateField` model for the supported aggregate attributes |
        |`filters`| This is used to specify one or more conditions for filtering the queried data. Refer to `NetworkApplicationFilterField` model for the supported filters |
        |`page`| It includes the **limit, cursor, and timeSortOrder** fields. *limit* denotes the number of records to process per page, *cursor* signifies the initial data position, and *timeSortOrder* is used sort the response based on the timestamp either in ascending or descending order. Default page limit is 100 and order is asc|

        Retrieves the trend analytics of applications experience data to the specific network application for the specified time range. The data will be grouped based on the given trend time interval. This API facilitates obtaining consolidated insights into the performance and status of the network applications over the specified start and end time. If startTime and endTime are not provided, the API defaults to the last 24 hours.`siteId` and `trendInterval` are mandatory. `siteId` must be a site UUID of a building.

        **The input payload contains the following fields,**
        |Field Name | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `startTime` | The start time indicates when the API begins retrieving data related to the resource. It must be specified in the UNIX epoch time format, measured in milliseconds. This value is inclusive, and if left unspecified, the default is 1 day before the  endTime.|
        | `endTime` | The end time indicates the upper limit until which the API retrieves data related to the resource. It must be defined in the UNIX epoch time format, measured in milliseconds. This value is inclusive, and if left unspecified, the default is the latest available data. |
        | `siteIds` |  The list of site UUIDs. This is a mandatory field. Please note that only Building UUIDs are allowed for this field. |
        | `trendInterval` |  The time window for aggregating metrics. This is a mandatory request field. Possible values include *5 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour or 3 hour. Upto 1 day time window allowed intervals 5MIN and 10MIN and more than 1 day time window allowed intervals 1HR and 3HR. |
        | `groupBy` | Specifies the attributes for grouping the data. Refer to `NetworkApplicationGroupByField` model for the supported grouping attributes|
        | `attributes` | A list of attributes associated with the resource, which can be requested to be included in the response alongside the required attributes. Refer to `NetworkApplicationTrendAttribute` model for the supported attributes |
        | `aggregateAttributes` | This specifies the attribute name and the function to be applied during data querying. The aggregate function is then applied to data within the specified start and end times. Refer to `NetworkApplicationAggregateField` model for the supported aggregate attributes |
        |`filters`| This is used to specify one or more conditions for filtering the queried data. Refer to `NetworkApplicationFilterField` model for the supported filters. The filter applicationName is not supported. |
        |`page`| It includes the **limit, cursor, and timeSortOrder** fields. *limit* denotes the number of records to process per page, *cursor* signifies the initial data position, and *timeSortOrder* is used sort the response based on the timestamp either in ascending or descending order. Default page limit is 100 and order is asc|

        Filtering on numerical fields (integer, number,etc.) will support the
        numerical operators:
